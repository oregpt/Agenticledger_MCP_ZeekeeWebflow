### 👋🐱 Gmeow Zircuit Frens!

We're back from an exciting couple of days at ETHTaipei, where we talked about the complexities of developing Zircuit on the OP Stack and chatted with industry giants including Vitalik Buterin, Jordi Baylina, Yuan Su, and Karl Floersch about Layer 2 solutions. Reflecting on our time at ETHTaipei, we're excited to share some key highlights and insights from our week. 

‍

### 🤖 A Dive into Zircuit's Tech with Dr. Martin Derka

To kick off the first day, Dr. Martin Derka, Technical lead and Co-Founder at Zircuit, talked about the complexities of blending optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, two technologies that, at first glance, seem like an unlikely pair. We outlined the existing ecosystem, the foundational elements required such as node infrastructure and ZK-EVMs, and the hurdles in integrating node infrastructure and ZK proofs together.

### 💡 ETHTaipei L2 Panel: A Gathering of Minds

The highlight of our ETHTaipei experience was the L2 panel featuring an ensemble of blockchain leaders, including Vitalik Buterin, Jordi Baylina, Yuan Su, Karl Floersch, and our very own Martin Derka. The discussion, buzzing over the recent updates on EIP-4844, revolved around strategies for making L2 solutions more affordable and secure.

The panel explored the future of data availability, interoperability, and the ongoing efforts to reduce fragmentation within the Ethereum ecosystem. The consensus was clear: embracing blobs, ensuring seamless cross-chain communication, and developing more inclusive governance models are pivotal for the future of Ethereum and L2 solutions.

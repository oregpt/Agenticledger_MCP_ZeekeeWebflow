# 👋🐱 Hi frens!

Over the last month, the Zircuit team attended a few exciting events all over Europe: **Ethereum Zurich**, **ChainScience 2024**, and **zkSummit 11**. We gave talks, collaborated with the best researchers, and wanted to share some highlights 👇

‍

# 🚞 Ethereum Zurich - An Introduction to Sequencer Level Security & EVM-Equivalence

Ethereum Zurich was packed full of interesting speakers with a wide range of knowledge. They spoke about new ZK bridges using SNARKs, corporate adoption of web3, and just about everything in between. 

On the first day, Dr. Jan Gorzny, Co-founder and Technical Lead at Zircuit spoke about how sequencer-level security can work in a rollup. Later that week, he was joined on a panel by researchers from Arbitrum, Tenderly, and Blockscout to discuss what it means to be EVM-equivalent and the future challenges facing rollups in this area.

# ⛓️ ChainScience 2024 - Comparing Rollups

Overlapping with Ethereum Zurich, ChainScience was a more academic conference where an international set of researchers presented their latest work on various topics. Jan was also there to present a paper collecting recent developments in the rollup space. 

Topics like modular rollups may be well-known in the Ethereum community at large but are not yet commonly discussed in academic research. The paper aims to encourage this discussion and provides a framework to compare various rollups.

# 💡  zkSummit 11

After Zurich, the team went to Athens for zkSummit 11. Here, the latest and greatest in ZK ideas were presented. We were humbled to be in such great company and made the best of it by meeting up with long-time collaborators, new partners, and upcoming researchers. While we didn’t give a talk, we were excited to see that the interest in this field is only growing and look forward to all the recent developments. Maybe we’ll give a talk next year 😉

# 🌟  See You Again Soon!

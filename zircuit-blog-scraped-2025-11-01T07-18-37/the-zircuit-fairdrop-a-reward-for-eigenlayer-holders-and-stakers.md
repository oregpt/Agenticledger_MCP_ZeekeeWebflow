The **Zircuit Fairdrop** has officially launched, exclusively for EigenLayer holders and stakers! This Fairdrop is a special opportunity to reward those who have actively supported Ethereum’s re-staking vision. All eligible wallets are receiving an equal reward, making this a fair and inclusive distribution regardless of stake size. Here’s everything you need to know to claim your reward and celebrate your contribution to Ethereum’s future.

‍

#### Why the Fairdrop for EIGEN Holders and Stakers?

EigenLayer has been a driving force in expanding Ethereum’s staking capabilities, with EIGEN holders leading this innovation. This Fairdrop acknowledges the critical impact of EigenLayer participants on Ethereum's mission, recognizing your role in pushing forward the re-staking movement and inviting you to help shape a more resilient and secure ecosystem with Zircuit.

‍

#### Equal Rewards for Everyone

In keeping with the ethos of fairness, Zircuit’s Fairdrop provides equal rewards for each eligible EIGEN holder. Unlike typical airdrops, where larger stakers might receive disproportionate rewards, Zircuit's approach emphasizes inclusivity—no whales, no favoritism.

_Please note:_ VC and EIGEN team wallets are excluded from this Fairdrop.

We've dropped 2% of the Zircuit token supply for this drop. We're also preparing an airdrop of ZRC tokens to EIGEN holders on exchanges—more information on this will be coming soon!

#### A Community-Driven Staking Future

The Zircuit Fairdrop is just the beginning. This initiative marks the first step in fostering a robust staking community on Zircuit. We have exciting plans on the horizon, so stay tuned—there’s always something new in the works.

Thank you for being part of this journey to build a fairer, more collaborative staking ecosystem.

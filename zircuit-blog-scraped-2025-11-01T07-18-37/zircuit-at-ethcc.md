We had so much fun connecting with all of you and chatting about your ideas and potential partnerships. Later that week, we dove into ETHGlobal Brussels, a hackathon designed to foster a thriving community, onboard developers into the web3 space, and bring experts together to build innovative projects.

## ⭐ And last but not least, congratulations to all of the bounty winners:

‍

### 1\. Best Project on Zircuit: [Ephi](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/ephi-1txc9)

Ephi brings web3 interactions to any web2 environment with a browser extension supporting dynamic context windows rendered from IPFS. Users can perform blockchain transactions directly from these windows. By utilizing IPFS for decentralized storage and a custom browser extension for rendering, Ephi makes blockchain accessible anywhere on the web. This is great as it brings blockchain technology to web2 platform users, where otherwise they would have never interacted with.

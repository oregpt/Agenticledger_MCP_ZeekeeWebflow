gmeow to everyone but especially devs!

Zircuit is excited to announce a new round of grants designed to empower builders and accelerate innovation within our ecosystem. This round features two dedicated tracks:

-   **Super App Track**: 2 grants of $135,000 ($50,000 in stablecoins and $85,000 in ZRC)
-   **Ecosystem Track**: 5 grants of $45,000 ($10,000 in stablecoins and $35,000 in ZRC)

The **Super App Track** is designed for projects with the potential to drive substantial  transaction volume, attract a wide community of web3 users, and potentially become flagship applications that help define what Zircuit is all about. If you’re working on something that could become a well-known name in the ecosystem, this track is designed with you in mind.

The **Ecosystem Track** supports projects that strengthen and strengthen the foundation of Zircuit, and complement the super apps. These may focus on specific use cases, important niches, or serve particular communities, but have the potential to grow meaningful traction and contribute to a diverse, resilient network. By enabling a wide range of builders, this track ensures that Zircuit grows across many different areas, creating an ecosystem that feels well-rounded rather than dominated by just a few major apps.

Applicants can choose which track best fits their product vision!

‍

## **Application Process**

The applications should be prepared as a GitHub repository with Markdown (.md) files. We prepared a [repository](https://github.com/zircuit-labs/grant-application-example) with instructions and sample content. Applicants should create a new **private** repository from this template and follow the instructions within. The completed applications should be shared with GitHub user `zircuit-grants25`, and can be submitted via [https://app.zircuit.com/build2025](https://app.zircuit.com/build2025).

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and grants will be awarded until funding capacity is reached. The Zircuit review team will prioritize projects with the highest potential to become widely used within the Zircuit ecosystem.

A strong application will include:

-   A clear and compelling project description
-   A feasible execution roadmap
-   Defined milestones
-   A transparent budget

If clarifications are needed, our reviewers may contact applicants directly via Telegram. Please keep an eye on your messages.

‍

## **Grant Details**

Grants will be awarded to projects that deploy applications on Zircuit. Each grant consists of a stablecoin payment and a matching allocation of ZRC from the community building fund.

-   Up to 25% of the total budget may be spent prior to deployment.
-   The remaining funds will be released after deployment and set milestones have been reached.
-   Final funding decisions rest at the discretion of the review team.

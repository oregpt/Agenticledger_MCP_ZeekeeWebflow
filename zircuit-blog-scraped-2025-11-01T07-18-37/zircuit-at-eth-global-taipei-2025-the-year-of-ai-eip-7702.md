From April 4–6, ETH Global Taipei 2025 brought together developers, builders, and visionaries from around the world to build, connect, and innovate at the intersection of blockchain and real-world use cases. With its vibrant local community and global reach, Taipei was the perfect backdrop for a weekend of creativity and collaboration. Zircuit is proud to be a sponsor of the event and our Head of Developer Relations, [Martinet Lee](https://x.com/martinetlee), also served as a finalist judge for the hackathon supporting developers across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

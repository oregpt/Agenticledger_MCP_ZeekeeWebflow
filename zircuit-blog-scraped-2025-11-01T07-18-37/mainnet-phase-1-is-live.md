# 💫 Mainnet Phase 1 is Live!

**Source:** https://www.zircuit.com/blog/mainnet-phase-1-is-live

We’re excited to announce that Zircuit's Mainnet Phase 1 is officially live! This marks a significant milestone in our journey to provide a secure, efficient, and groundbreaking platform for decentralized applications.

Mainnet Phase 1 (Developer Mainnet) also includes the launch of the Zircuit Mainnet Festival, a first-of-its-kind program that rewards ZRC and a chance to win large prizes in proportion to gas spent on the Zircuit network. These new milestones build upon a strong foundation of over $2.5B in assets staked in Zircuit’s staking program, and dozens of ecosystem projects deploying their applications in the coming weeks.

### **👐 Airdrop Season 1: ZRC Token Claim Now Open**

We’re opening the ZRC airdrop claim for those who participated in the Season 1 points campaign. To claim your tokens, visit [claim.zircuit.com](http://claim.zircuit.com/).

7% of the total ZRC supply is allocated for Season 1 points earners. Thank you to all of our stakers, builders, partners, and contributors, enjoy those juicy rewards, you deserve it!

Missed out on Season 1? No worries, Season 2 is currently live and there’s still plenty more rewards to earn! An additional 14% of ZRC is allocated for future staking and usage-based rewards.

‍

### ‍**🤩 Mainnet Phase 1 - Help us Test and Earn ZRC!**

At the start of Mainnet, only ETH bridging will be enabled and wallets will have a bridging cap of 1 ETH. This phased approach ensures Zircuit launches in the most responsible way and provides a broader distribution of Zircuit rewards to smaller wallets. 

We’re rewarding 20,000,000 ZRC to be distributed amongst users who participate in the Mainnet Festival to help test the Zircuit network. Users can earn at least 125% in ZRC for all ETH spent on gas, as well as a chance to win further prizes such as a super prize of 100,000 ZRC. [Bridge ETH](https://bridge.zircuit.com/) and test Zircuit today!

During testing, the caps will be gradually lifted, other assets can be bridged over and it will enable interactions with more dApps that require more asset types. We will bring along our partners who play a crucial role in our ecosystem, including: [**Renzo**](https://www.renzoprotocol.com/)**,** [**DODO**](https://dodoex.io/en)**,** [**Zuit**](https://t.co/KrKqjYaDU8)**,** [**Particle Network**](https://particle.network/)**,** [**ZeroLend**](https://zerolend.xyz/)**,** [**Ambient Finance**](https://ambient.finance/)**,** [**Ethena**](https://ethena.fi/)**,** [**Lynx**](https://www.lynx.finance/)**,** [**InstaDapp**](https://instadapp.io/)**,** [**LogX**](https://app.logx.trade/)**,** [**Shoebill**](https://shoebill.finance/#/), and many more.

### **🎪 Zircuit Mainnet Festival**

[Join the Zircuit Mainnet Festival](https://festival.zircuit.com/mainnet) to earn ZRC rewards and a chance to win the super prize of 100,000 ZRC! Every transaction executed on Zircuit spends gas fees paid in ETH. ZRC tokens are rewarded in proportion to the amount of ETH spent, including both base and priority fees. The [rewards simulator](http://festival.zircuit.com) makes it easy to calculate your base ZRC rewards.

Users earn 1 roll for every 0.01 ETH they spend on gas fees. Rolls give users the chance to earn random ZRC prizes. Each roll also has a chance to hit the super prize of 100,000 ZRC. 

Eligible transactions include simple transfers, deployments, and interactions with dApps on the Zircuit network. 

ZRC has a Total Supply of 10B tokens. Note that ZRC is non-transferable until TGE.

### **📜 Migrate your assets to claim**

Starting today, Zircuit will collect signatures from users who want to commit their staked assets for migration from Ethereum over to Zircuit. The assets will remain staked and won’t move to Mainnet until a later phase. Users can always withdraw their assets at any time. Users who wish to commit their assets to the migration and claim their airdrop can do so by visiting [http://claim.zircuit.com/](http://claim.zircuit.com/).

##### **👋🐱 Gmeow Zircuit Community!** 

We’re super excited to introduce the Zircuit Staking Program, offering users the opportunity to stake ETH, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) to earn Zircuit Points. Zircuit is a new L2 backed by Dragonfly, Pantera Capital and Maelstrom.

Following the rapid growth of EigenLayer, Zircuit is leveraging a growing surge in interest around restaking protocols. The enthusiasm we've seen in just the first 24 hours has been incredible, with **over $129M in total value locked** (TVL) on the Ethereum mainnet.

‍

##### **❇️ Zircuit Points**

The Zircuit staking program is designed to reward participating users and communities that help bootstrap native, day-one liquidity to Zircuit. Users can earn yield and points on their deposits, including the yield from ETH staking, EigenLayer points, liquid restaking protocol points, and Zircuit points.

Unlike other platforms, your assets aren't locked in; you can withdraw at any time, keeping all earned points and yields.

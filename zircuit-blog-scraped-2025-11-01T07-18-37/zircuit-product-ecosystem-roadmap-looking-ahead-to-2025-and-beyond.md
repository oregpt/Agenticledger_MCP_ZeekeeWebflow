# Zircuit Product & Ecosystem Roadmap, Part IV: Looking ahead to 2025 and Beyond

**Source:** https://www.zircuit.com/blog/zircuit-product-ecosystem-roadmap-looking-ahead-to-2025-and-beyond

As we wrap up our roadmap mini-series, we’re excited to share Zircuit’s AI centric vision for our products and ecosystem. Please note that any forward-looking statements in this post are based on our current understanding and planning but remain subject to change as market conditions evolve. This is not financial advice (NFA).

‍

## A Brief Review

Before we look ahead, we’d like to take a moment to reflect on some of our most significant milestones to date: 

-   **In March:** We launched our first-of-its-kind re-restaking program, which attracted over [$3 billion](https://x.com/ZircuitL2/status/1786791681087480156) in LRTs and LSTs and brought in over 110,000 unique users. 
-   **In July:** Zircuit completed its [strategic round](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/zircuit-raises-mainnet-funding-round-with-participation-from-binance-labs-mirana-ventures-and-others) with participation from top investors and founders, including Binance Labs, Mirana Ventures, Robot Ventures.
-   **In November:** The long-awaited Zircuit Token ([ZRC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zircuit)) token generation event went live with over 300,000 holders receiving ZRC, which became tradable on major exchanges such as ByBit, Bitget, Bithumb, Crypto.com, and other top exchanges. 
-   **Today:** Zircuit boasts a thriving [ecosystem](https://www.zircuit.com/#ecosystem), where users can [swap](https://app.zircuit.com/dex), [lend/borrow](https://app.zircuit.com/lending), and [stake](https://app.zircuit.com/liquidity-hub) assets on Zircuit mainnet with peace of mind, knowing their transactions are being protected by [Sequencer Level Security (SLS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01819).

## Vision for 2025 and Beyond

### Deeper AI Integration

AI has been central to Zircuit since its inception. Long before the recent [AI boom](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/crypto-and-ai-shaping-the-future-of-the-internet), Zircuit was the first to use AI to monitor transactions on the blockchain and prevent hacks through [S](https://docs.zircuit.com/architecture-and-concepts/sequencer-level-security-Asls)[LS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01819). Moving forward, we’re doubling down on AI, and will be exploring new and novel ways of integrating AI into Zircuit. 

[The explosion of AI agents and DeFAI](https://decrypt.co/300983/ai-agent-tokens-skyrocket-frankling-templeton-promise) is a pivotal moment for crypto adoption and UX, but there are significant challenges to create applications that can be trusted with millions of users’ funds. For DeFAI to scale, it needs an even higher focus on security than conventional DeFi, as it presents an even broader attack surface. Beyond smart contract security, DeFAI agents and applications are exposed to unique and developing threats such as prompt injection attacks, RAG poisoning and jailbreaking.

Zircuit is uniquely positioned to create a safe environment for DeFAI agents and tools to operate multichain strategies due to our technical expertise in security innovation.

**Here are some of the initiatives we are exploring:**

-   Developing omnichain DeFAI agents with tools for executing trades, managing liquidity, and optimizing yield strategies with minimal user input.
-   Building frameworks that allow builders to integrate AI seamlessly into their applications on Zircuit as well as other leading chains.
-   Developing frameworks and products for agentic security, which Zircuit is uniquely positioned to do. 
-   Providing low-latency communication and access to novel data sources for AI agents.
-   Continuing to expand SLS so that AI agents and users can transact securely on the blockchain, minimizing hacks, exploits, and rug pulls.
-   Helping AI products on Zircuit like Gud Tech with resources and go-to market assistance, as they set out to bring AI on Zircuit to millions of users.

Our ultimate vision is to establish Zircuit as the Cognitive Chain, a hub for secure, AI-driven, automated finance. Check out [Gud Tech](https://gud.tech/) for the latest AI alpha on Zircuit.

### Enhanced Chain User Experience

Another focus for Zircuit has been on user experience. When we launched the [Liquidity Hub](https://app.zircuit.com/liquidity-hub), one of our top priorities was making it as easy and safe for users to earn boosted yields across 25+ LRTs/LSTs. Over 100,000 users have trusted Zircuit with over $1 billion in staked assets. Given the scale of usage, we plan to continue improving the onchain UX on Zircuit, and here are some of the things we’re cooking up:

-   **Better Bridges.** 
    -   Today the main way to bring assets onto the network is through our [native bridge](https://bridge.zircuit.com/), and though very secure, gas fees may be high when transferring assets between Ethereum and Zircuit. We’ve already brought on partners like [Rhino](https://app.rhino.fi/bridge?chain=SCROLL&token=USDT&chainOut=ZIRCUIT) to make bridging faster and more cost-effective, with more solutions on the way.
-   **Account abstraction for cross-chain DeFAI**
    -   The future is [empirically omnichain](https://app.debridge.finance/analytics). The data concludes that users typically switch across chains for the best opportunities, and with plans for cross-chain yield and trading, account abstraction will matter hugely for user experience. Dedicating resources here means that users can easily store funds on Zircuit, and transact everywhere with minimal friction.
-   **Cross-Chain Yield & Trading.** 
    -   Just as the Liquidity Hub acts as a curator and aggregator of the best LRTs/LRTs – we want Zircuit to be a one-stop-shop for users to access the best yield opportunities across all networks and chains. We’re thinking of clever ways to achieve this, one of which is to use AI agents to find the best yield and trading opportunities in crypto, and providing access to these opportunities to users through an automated trading vault (cc: [Gud Tech](https://gud.tech/)).
-   **Differentiated app selection.**
    -   It’s only been a few months since Zircuit mainnet went fully live and there are already some great projects on Zircuit, like [Gud Tech](https://gud.tech/), [Ocelex](https://ocelex.fi/), [Zuit](https://zuit.xyz/pool), [Dodo](https://app.dodoex.io/swap/network/zircuit-mainnet/48900-ETH/48900-WETH), [Elara](https://app.elara.finance/markets), [ZeroLend](https://app.zerolend.xyz/?marketName=proto_zircuit_v3), and [many more](https://www.zircuit.com/#ecosystem). We’re focused on onboarding unique and differentiated builders and projects in categories like DeFAI.

### Multichain Security

We know the hesitation that comes with depositing your hard-earned money into a new DeFi app with the possibility that it might get hacked or exploited. That’s why Zircuit was designed with a security-first approach, prioritizing robust protection for users’ assets through our built-in SLS. Security has always been at the core of our mission, and as we look to the future, we’re exploring ways of extending our security capabilities beyond just Zircuit, especially given our ambitions to make multichain DeFAI agents. 

**Key ideas include:**

-   Automated Auditing: Tools for AI agents to review smart contracts before funds are deployed to a DeFi protocol.
-   Proactive Monitoring: monitoring programs that oversee AI agents' DeFi positions and activities, triggering alerts or automatic actions in case of hacks or anomalies.

These enhancements align with our ambition to create multichain DeFAI agents, ensuring users’ assets remain secure across networks.

# Conclusion

And that wraps up our roadmap miniseries for 2025 and beyond! We’d like to extend a big thank you to our users, community, partners, and builders for helping to make Zircuit’s journey possible. Your support has been instrumental, and we’re excited to keep building alongside you as we shape the future of decentralized finance. Let’s continue pushing boundaries—see you onchain!

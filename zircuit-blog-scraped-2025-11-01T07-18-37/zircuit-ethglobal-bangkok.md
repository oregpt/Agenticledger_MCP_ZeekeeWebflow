#### **Best Project on Zircuit**

##### **🏆 1st Place ($3000):** [**Cat in a Box**](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/cat-in-a-box-y6ecj)

Cat in a Box is a DeSci and Social Fi platform that addresses the lengthy process of translating scientific discoveries into practical applications, particularly in personalized health. It empowers users to participate in community-driven scientific studies, share health data securely, and earn cryptocurrency rewards. The platform ensures user-owned data by encrypting and storing it on-chain using Filecoin's decentralized storage. It also employs Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) computation via Phala for secure data processing. With an intuitive interface, Cat in a Box facilitates seamless participation in decentralized science (DeSci) projects, fostering transparent experimentation and data collection.

##### **🏆 2nd Place ($1200):** [**Trust Issues**](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/trust-issues-3wnx4)

Safely exiting Layer 2 rollups in a world of centralized sequencers AKA escape hatch is not that straight forward. Trust Issues simplifies the process of exiting Layer 2 rollups through Layer 1, ensuring users can withdraw assets even if the Layer 2 becomes unresponsive or compromised. This application acts as an intermediary between Layer 2 decentralized applications (dApps) and Layer 1, constructing and executing withdrawal transactions without requiring advanced technical knowledge. Built with React and Tauri, and utilizing WalletConnect for standardized communication, Trust Issues enhances the security and accessibility of Ethereum's multi-layer ecosystem.

##### **🏆 3rd Place ($800):** [**Truman AI Live**](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/truman-ai-live-946mf)

Truman AI Live offers an interactive AI-driven simulation where users influence the journey of Truman Burbank. The platform features a World AI that orchestrates events and intelligent agents with memory and autonomy, creating a dynamic narrative experience. Users can propose and wager on real-time outcomes, actively shaping the storyline. Developed using Next.js and powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, Truman AI Live provides a unique blend of gaming and AI, allowing users to engage with lifelike characters and scenarios.

#### **Best Telegram App Integration**

##### **🏆 1st Place ($3000):** [**hAUTH**](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/hauth-ngzy6)

hAUTH is a Telegram bot designed for human authentication and management of on-chain AI agents. Users can register AI agents and set predefined conditions for their on-chain behavior, such as transaction value limits and gas limits. When an agent meets these conditions, hAUTH sends an authentication request via Telegram, allowing users to approve or deny the transaction. The AI agents operate within a TEE on the Phala Network, ensuring tamper-proof outputs. By integrating 1inch Fusion for cross-chain swapping, hAUTH empowers users to securely manage AI agents within the on-chain economy.

##### **🏆 2nd Place ($2000):** [**Cap or No Cap**](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/cap-or-no-cap-m8k1t)

Cap or No Cap combats fraudulent trading profit-and-loss (PnL) claims by promoting transparency in the trading community. Through an interactive Telegram bot, users can upload PnL screenshots, which are processed using AI-powered image parsing to extract critical details. The platform employs zero-knowledge proof algorithms to verify the authenticity of trades against public blockchain data. By providing real-time feedback on the validity of trading claims, Cap or No Cap fosters accountability and trust within the trading ecosystem.

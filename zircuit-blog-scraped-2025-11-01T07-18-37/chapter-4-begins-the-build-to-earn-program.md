# 👷‍♂️ Chapter 4 Begins: The Build to Earn Program

Since the launch of Zircuit Staking, the Zircuit ecosystem has amassed over $800M in staked assets, with collaboration from top projects such as Ethena, Ether.fi, KelpDAO, Renzo, Hashflow, API3, Galxe, Elixir, Blocto, Eigenpie, and many others! As we continue down the road to mainnet, we look forward to many more builders and contributors becoming a part of our fast-growing ecosystem.

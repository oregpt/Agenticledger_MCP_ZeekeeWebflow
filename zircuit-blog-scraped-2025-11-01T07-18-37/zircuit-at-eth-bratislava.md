We just got back from ETH Bratislava last month! We had a blast meeting some of y’all and sharing our insights on scalability solutions for Ethereum.

ICYMI, we broke our talk down for you below 👇

‍

# 📈 Why Scaling Ethereum Matters

We kicked things off by explaining why scaling Ethereum is so important. For applications like gaming and high-frequency trading, Ethereum needs to handle a massive number of transactions quickly and efficiently. Beyond that, scalability is key to broader goals like banking the unbanked and driving mass adoption of blockchain technology. Right now, Ethereum’s limitations make it tough to support the volume of transactions needed for these big ideas to become reality.

‍

## 🔺 The Scalability Trilemma

Next, we dove into the scalability trilemma, which is all about balancing decentralization, security, and scalability. This is a big challenge because improving one aspect often means compromising another.

‍

## 🧑‍💻 Existing Solutions and Innovations

We explored several solutions that have been proposed and implemented to scale Ethereum:

\- **State Channels**: These let transactions happen offchain, reducing the load on Ethereum itself. They’re secure and help scale transactions, but they don’t scale the number of users.

\- **Sidechains**: These are independent blockchains that run alongside Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, higher hardware requirements results in fewer nodes, making them less secure and more centralized than the main chain.

\- **Plasma**: This was one of the first “Layer 2” solutions, handling computation offchain and state verification onchain. It supports unlimited users and is secured by Ethereum, but has its own challenges like data availability attacks.

\- **Rollups**: These aggregate multiple transactions into one, significantly increasing throughput. They come in two flavors: optimistic rollups and ZK rollups, both providing onchain state verification and data availability.

\- **Validiums**: Similar to rollups but with offchain data availability, offering a different balance of performance and security.

# 💚 Zircuit's Cutting-Edge Solutions

And last but not least, we talked about Zircuit's solutions to Ethereum's scalability! We introduced some interesting features like:

\- **Sequencer Level Security**: Built in security for dApp developers to monitor transactions in real-time, quarantine suspicious ones, and manually approve them if needed.

\- **Proprietary Provers**: Our zkEVM, built on Halo2, uses the OP stack to support ZK technology, offering 100% EVM compatibility with smart batching, fast checks, and hardware accelerations.

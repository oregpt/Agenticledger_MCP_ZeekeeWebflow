#### We just got back from TOKEN2049—we had so much fun meeting all of you and hope you all enjoyed our exclusive merch at our booth and events! 

‍

# ZirCat Lounge: The Purrrfect Workspace

On September 17, we joined forces with [Catizen](https://catizen.ai/) to host the ZirCat Lounge—a coworking space filled with rescue kittens. We hope you enjoyed the cozy environment and got the chance to relax, connect, and get work done alongside your fuzzy companions.

Thank you to everyone who dropped by to play with the kittens—we hope you had a great time and perhaps found a new feline friend to consider!

# Mansion Mixer: An Evening to Remember

To close out the week, we teamed up with [Nomad Capital](https://x.com/NomadCapital_io), [Initia](https://x.com/initiaFDN), [Quantstamp](https://x.com/Quantstamp) and [Hypernative](https://x.com/HypernativeLabs) for our Mansion Mixer on September 20 at The RiverHouse. We hope you enjoyed the live LED traditional Chinese drum performances, DJ Kaylova, and cocktails that made for an unforgettable evening!

#### And last but not least, a big thanks to everyone who came out to meet the Zircuit team at TOKEN2049 this year—see you all again next year!

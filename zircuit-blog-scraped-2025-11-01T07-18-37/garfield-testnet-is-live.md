👋🐱 Gmeow!

Big news, frens—Garfield Testnet is live! This isn’t just any testnet; it’s a massive upgrade bringing Cancun and Pectra opcodes, an enhanced prover, and a next-gen proving cluster. 

Let’s break it down 👇

‍

### **What’s New in Garfield Testnet?**

Garfield is setting the stage for the next evolution of Zircuit, packed with powerful features:

🔥 **Full Cancun Opcode Support** – Developers can now build and test with the latest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enhancements. 

🔥 **Pectra-Ready** – Garfield is structured to seamlessly integrate Pectra once Ethereum activates it. 🔥 **Enhanced Prover** – A turbocharged prover that validates all blocks more efficiently, scaling Zircuit to the next level. 

🔥 **Proving Cluster Testing** – Optimization and evaluation of our proving infrastructure to ensure peak performance. 

🔥 **EIP-7702 Ready** – We’re bringing support for EIP-7702, with a dedicated update coming soon.

‍

### **Fresh Testnet, Fresh Setup**

Garfield is a brand-new network, meaning you’ll need to update your setup. Here’s what you need to know:

📍 **Chain ID:** 48898 

🔗 **RPC Endpoint:** [https://garfield-testnet.zircuit.com](https://garfield-testnet.zircuit.com/) 

🔍 **Block Explorer:** [https://explorer.garfield-testnet.zircuit.com](https://explorer.garfield-testnet.zircuit.com/) 

🌉 **Bridge:** [https://bridge.garfield-testnet.zircuit.com](https://bridge.garfield-testnet.zircuit.com/)

‍

### **Testnet Transition Plan**

Our current testnet will sunset on **May 31, 2025**. Withdraw any Sepolia ETH or testnet assets before then! An escape hatch will be available for post-transition withdrawals.

‍

### **Coming to Mainnet Soon™**

Garfield’s updates aren’t just for testnet. We’re bringing these enhancements to Zircuit mainnet in March 2025 ahead of Pectra’s Ethereum activation. Expect a seamless transition—no action needed from users. 

‍

### **Mainnet Enhancements Incoming**

Alongside Garfield, we’re supercharging mainnet with:

⚡ **Faster RPCs** – High-speed, low-latency RPCs for improved stability. 

🔍 **Upgraded Block Explorer** – Sourcify integration makes contract verification easier than ever. 

🌉 **Revamped Bridge** – A smoother, faster withdrawal process with more optimizations. 

🚪 **Escape Hatch Deployment** – Permissionless withdrawals will be fully supported, ensuring forever access to funds in case the sequencer isn’t available.

‍

### **What’s Next?**

We’re not stopping here. More updates on EIP-7702 support and prover optimizations are coming soon.

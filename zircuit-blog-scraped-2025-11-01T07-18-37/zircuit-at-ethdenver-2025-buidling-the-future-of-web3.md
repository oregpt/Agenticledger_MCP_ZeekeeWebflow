## **Best Project on Zircuit**

### _1st Place:_ [_Nextmate.ai_](https://devfolio.co/projects/nextmateai-b4ad)

Nextmate.ai is a decentralized, AI-driven prediction market platform that empowers cryptocurrencies with practical use cases and real utility. Unlike centralized platforms, Nextmate.ai allows users to create their own prediction pools, ensuring fairness and decentralization. The platform integrates AI to provide probability analyses, assisting users in making informed decisions. Additionally, participants receive token airdrop incentives based on their engagement, further enhancing the platform's appeal.

### _2nd Place:_ [_Silverbacks Crypto Cash_](https://devfolio.co/projects/silverbacks-crypto-cash-3508)

Silverbacks Crypto Cash bridges the gap between traditional paper money and digital cryptocurrencies. By converting physical bills into digital assets using NFTs, the platform offers a familiar representation of value, simplifying the onboarding process for crypto newcomers. Each physical bill is embedded with an NFC chip and a QR code, ensuring secure redemption and enhanced security. This innovative approach makes cash-to-crypto conversion more accessible and user-friendly. Even Zircat grandma would be able to use such bills to purchase assets, while others, more tech savvy, can convert those into digital currency.

### _1st Place:_ [_Pixie AI_](https://devfolio.co/projects/pixie-ai-6544)

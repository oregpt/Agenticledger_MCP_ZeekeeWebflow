# Zircuit’s Community Testnet Launch

Today we are thrilled to announce the launch of Zircuit’s public testnet. Zircuit is a 100% EVM-compatible zero-knowledge rollup powering the limitless potential of web3. Backed by pioneering L2 research, the network’s unique hybrid architecture combines battle-tested infrastructure with zero-knowledge proofs. In celebration of the public testnet launch, Zircuit will be hosting a [multi-day event](https://lu.ma/zircuitcafe) at Devconnect that kicks off on Monday, November 13th.

  
Over the last year and a half, the Zircuit team has pioneered various research initiatives like rollup security tooling, rollup compression, and scaling cryptography. We used the best tools available to develop an evolved L2 environment for developers. From DeFi primitives to core infrastructure projects, the support from early partners has been incredible.  
  

## Come Build on Zircuit

  
Zircuit’s journey is just getting started, and we’re thrilled to open the door for developers and projects from across the web3 ecosystem to participate. It takes minutes to get onboarded and deploy a contract, and everything that works on Ethereum works on Zircuit.  
  
We’ve had amazing early support from our testnet launch partners Blocto, Chainstack, Galxe, Rarible, Hashflow, API3, Thesis, Gelato, Elixir, Privy, Biconomy and dozens of others. The roads aren’t fully built out yet, and the network will undergo live testing, updates and improvements. We’re excited to witness the possibilities and grateful to the early builders joining us on the path towards mainnet.  
  

To celebrate the community testnet launch, we’re holding a [4-day cafe event](https://lu.ma/zircuitcafe) at Devconnect along with a launch party where you’ll have the chance to chat with the team and learn more about Zircuit. We have a lot in the works for early developers and users to be announced over the coming weeks, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zircuit) and follow us on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/ZircuitL2) to be the first to find out what’s next.

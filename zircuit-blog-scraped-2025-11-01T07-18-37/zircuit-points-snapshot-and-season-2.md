# **👋🐱 hello frens!**

With the Zircuit Mainnet launch just around the corner, we wanted to share some important updates with y’all ✨

‍

## 📸 **Snapshot Date: July 7th**

We’ll be taking a snapshot of all Zircuit Points earned from Season 1 (including Build to Earn, Staking, Zircats, the OG campaign, and more) on July 7th. This snapshot will lock in your Points balance as we gear up for the next chapter.

Thanks to all of you for your support in Season 1 🤗 We’re so excited to see what you’ll do in Season 2!

‍

## **2️⃣ Season 2 Starts on July 8th**

Don’t worry - if you’re already staking at [**stake.zircuit.com**](https://stake.zircuit.com/?utm_source=zircuit.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=zircuit-points-snapshot-and-season-2), you’re all set! Just stay staked, and you’ll continue earning Points.

We’ll continue to reward staking users for their participation, so make sure to stake more to maximize your Season 2 rewards!

**More ways to earn rewards are coming soon! Stay tuned** 😼

‍

See you again soon~

The Zircuit Team 💚
